# K-Nearest-Neighbours-KNN-
This project focuses on implementing the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm to classify animal types based on the given dataset. KNN is a simple, yet powerful, machine learning algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity to labeled examples in the training dataset.
